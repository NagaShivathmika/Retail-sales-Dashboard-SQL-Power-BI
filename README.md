# 🛍️ Retail Sales Dashboard – SQL + Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview:

Retail businesses often struggle to extract actionable insights from raw transactional data. This project simulates a real-world analytics workflow — from data cleaning and exploration in SQL to dashboard design in Power BI — to help decision-makers understand customer behavior, product performance, and seasonal sales trends.

### 🧠 Problem Statement

How can a retail business use data to identify top-selling products, segment customers, and optimize seasonal campaigns?

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- SQL: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard design with KPIs, filters, and drill-downs

### 🔍 What I Did

- Cleaned and segmented a retail sales dataset using SQL
- Performed EDA to uncover trends in:
- Customer demographics (age, gender)
- Product category performance
- Monthly sales fluctuations
- Built a Power BI dashboard with:
- KPI cards (Revenue, Avg Order Value, Transactions, Quantity)
- Line chart for monthly sales
- Bar and pie charts for product performance
- Age group drill-down and gender filters

### ⚙️ Key SQL Techniques

- GROUP BY, JOIN, CASE, DATEPART, COUNT DISTINCT
- Aggregated revenue and quantity by product category and month
- Segmented customers by age and gender
